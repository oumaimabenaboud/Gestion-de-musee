## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project environment and install the required dependencies.

### Step 1: Install Virtual Environment Wrapper (Windows)

```bash
py -m pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
py -m venv myvenv
```

### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These commands create a virtual environment named "myvenv" and activate it. Then, it installs the project dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file.

Now, your environment is set up, and you are ready to work on the project.
